#### About me

Hello! My name is Ali. I'm a Computer Engineering fresh graduate passionate about Cybersecurity and Programming. I worked for Commercial International Bank - CIB Egypt as an IT Service Desk Technical Analyst for six months. Then I left my job to get into Cybersecurity world.

On 1st of Dec 2019 - One month after my resignation - I started a three months scholarship from Information Technology Institute (ITI) in Penetration Testing. During the scholarship, I got a lot of knowledge in Computer Networking, Security, System Administration (Windows and Linux), and Programming. As well, I studied [EC-Council](https://www.eccouncil.org/) courses (Certified Network Defender - CND, Certified Ethical Hacker - CEH, and EC-Council Certified Security Analyst - ECSA.).

Currently, Iâ€™m working on improving my hacking skills through participation in online CTF competitions and practice on online hacking labs so that I can get an entry-level job in the Cybersecurity field.

This blog is made mainly for publishing my beginner-friendly CTF challenges' write-ups. I may share my technical notes, write up some tutorials about any tools I would learn, share any resources I could find, or share my preparation progress for any cybersecurity-related certification/exam. So, try to keep an eye on this blog as you may find it helpful, especially if you are a beginner in the Cybersecurity field.
