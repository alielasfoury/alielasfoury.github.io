#### About me
My name is Ali. I'm a Computer Engineering fresh graduate interested in Cybersecurity. I worked for Commercial International Bank - CIB Egypt as an IT Service Desk Technical Analyst for six months. Then I left my job to get into Cybersecurity world.

On 1st of Dec 2019 - One month after my resignation - I started a three months scholarship from Information Technology Institute (ITI) in Penetration Testing. During the scholarship, I got a lot of knowledge in Computer Networking, Security, System Administration (Windows and Linux), and Programming. As well, I studied and got exam vouchers for [EC-Council](https://www.eccouncil.org/) courses (Certified Network Defender - CND, Certified Ethical Hacker - CEH, and EC-Council Certified Security Analyst - ECSA.) and currently I'm preparing for their exams.

As well, I've started to participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions on 1st of June to improve my hacking skills. I got the 601st place (5070 Players) on my third CTF - NahamCon CTF [[Visit my profile on CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/user/82926)]. Then I created a team called [N0p5l3d](https://ctftime.org/team/123768) with my friend [Nico](https://ctftime.org/user/52467) who I met at NahamCon CTF and now the team has grown and has 15 members from diverse countries.
