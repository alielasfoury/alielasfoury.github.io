just a login page

Nothing interesting in the page source

lets try to login with any name and see what happens

enter any name then click on login

I entered hello, and the response came up with a page saying that only admin can see the flag and a cookie item named user with value uryyb

so let's go back again and login with admin 
but it responded that login as admin has been disabled!

The only thing we have right now is the cookie item user

the value of user item is mostly encrypted. so we can take that value and try to decrypt it 

the first thing that came to my mind is that the value is mostly encrypted with rot13

so let's try to decrypt it

and yes its ROT13 encrypted indeed and the output is hello which is the username we tried to login with

so lets try to encrypt “admin” 

![image](/assets/images/writeups/nahamcon-ctf/{{ page.title}}/7.png)

then get the encrypted output and change the value of the cookie item user with the encrypted username admin and resend the request/refresh the page

 Congratulations here is your flag!
