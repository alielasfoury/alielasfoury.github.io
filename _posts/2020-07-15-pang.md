This is a writeup for Pang challenge from NahamCon CTF.

as usual after downloading the file, we should check the file type

just a png image, but if we tried to open it with any image viewer, it gives the below error.

Fatal error reading PNG image file: IHDR: CRC error

after googling the above error, I found that the png image is missing something and needs a repair.
then I found a tool on github to check and repair png images.

After running the tool, it found errors and prompted to repair it and finally it's repaired

yes, it has the flag

we can run image2text tool to get the text out of the image. It's not that accurate, but at least you won't rewrite this long flag from the beginning, just a few characters to write or replace.
