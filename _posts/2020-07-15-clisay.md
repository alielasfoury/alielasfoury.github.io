This is a writeup for Clisay challenge from NahamCon CTF.

lets download the file to what we can do with it

open up the terminal

then lets check the file type with the file command

it's just an executable file

if we ran ls -la to see the permissions of the file, we would see that it's not executable. so let's give it the executable permission bit.

chmod +x file

not it's executable, let's run it

It just outputs some strings

let's see if it contains any interesting printable characters with the strings command

Done, We can easily notice the flag. It is splited into two halfs. We can use grep to extract its halfs

If you don't like to copy and paste the two halfs XD, You can simply run the below line of command

`flag{Y0u_c4n_r3Ad_M1nd5}`
