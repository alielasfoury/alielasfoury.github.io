This is a writeup for Vortex challenge from NahamCon CTF.

nc jh2i.com 50017

it asked us to connect to the specified port using netcat

after connecting to that port, it continuously thrown an enourmous amount of non-readable characters to the standard input.

so, let's connect again but this time we will pass the non-readable characters to the strings command to get the printable characters then pipe the output to grep command to filter the flag string. It just took about 30 seconds to get the flag. Once it's found, just stop the command process by pressing `ctrl + c`.
