This is a write-up for Metameme challenge from NahamCon CTF.

Again, we have just a file for this challenge and the file is an image.

Mostly there would be some hidden data inside that image. So, let's use `exiftool` to see the meta information of the image so we can get anything important.

dadaaa, the flag is lying down there! Another easy challenge!

`flag{N0t_7h3_4cTuaL_Cr3At0r}`

Also, we could have used strings command to see the printable characters in the image file.
